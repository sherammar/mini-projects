# 🍕 Pizza Order Program

A beginner-friendly Python project that takes user input to order a pizza, choose toppings, and calculate the final bill.

## 💡 What I Gained
- Practiced handling **user input** and converting responses to lowercase.
- Strengthened understanding of **conditional statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- Learned how to perform **step-by-step calculations** based on user choices.
- Improved program flow and user interaction in a **console-based app**.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the program in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python pizza_order.py
